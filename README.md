# Enlightened Pitch
Enlightened Pitch is a collection manager for [Flesh and Blood TCG](https://fabtcg.com/). It's main goal is to help players keep track of their cards' collection from a player's perspective (playsets for different formats, deckbuilder, missing cards for played classes, collection progress, want/trade lists...).
